    <h1>"Princess Elsa"</h1>

    <h2>Inspiration and Critical Thinking</h2>
    <p>I would like to further investigate TouchDesigner and its capabilities. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the integration of Kinect with a computer to control particle effects within TouchDesigner from this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em1Y5qVMiAs&t=1s.

    <p>I discovered that the Kinect is unable to connect with my Macbook. As a result, I will be simplifying the "controlling particles" process by utilizing the camera inside TouchDesigner, rather than relying on the Kinect. Here is the diagram for my TD project.

    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p>"Princess Elsa" is an interactive project developed in TouchDesigner. It integrates real-time body movement tracking, creating an interactive experience in which the user's movements are followed by a dynamic snowflake effect. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>Optical Flow: This function captures the user's body movements via a camera. It allows real-time motion tracking within TouchDesigner.</p>

    <p>ParticleGPU System: The snowflake effect is generated using the ParticleGPU function. These particles follow the flow of the user's movements, giving the appearance that the user is controlling the snowflakes.</p>
        
    <p>Interactive Visuals: As the user moves, the snowflakes follow their gestures, resulting in a magical, flowing interaction reminiscent of Princess Elsa's snowpowers.

    <h2>Technology Stacks</h2>
    <p>Camera Input: Captures and feeds the user's body movements into the system.</p>

    <p>Optical Flow: Detects and analyzes movement for dynamic interaction.</p>
        
    <p>ParticlesGPU: Renders and controls the snowflake particles following the user's motion.</p>

    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>I cannot upload a long video here, so I just uploaded 2 GIFs. You can see that my head and hands are moving left and right.

    <p>Yeah! I am Princess Elsa now!</p>
